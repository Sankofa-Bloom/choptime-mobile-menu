## Delivery Logic

### Zone-Based Pricing
The system uses intelligent zone-based pricing:
- Each town has multiple delivery zones
- Zones are defined by distance ranges (0-2km, 2-5km, etc.)
- Automatic fee calculation based on address keywords
- Fallback to minimum zone fee if no match

### Default Zones
**Buea:**
- Town Center (0-2km): 500 FCFA
- Suburbs (2-5km): 800 FCFA  
- Outskirts (5km+): 1200 FCFA

**Limbe:**
- Mile 1-2 (0-3km): 600 FCFA
- Mile 3-4 (3-6km): 900 FCFA
- Down Beach & Beyond (6km+): 1400 FCFA

## Order Flow

1. **Customer Journey**
   - Select town (Buea/Limbe)
   - Browse dishes by category
   - Choose restaurant for each dish
   - Add to cart with quantities
   - Fill delivery details
   - Generate WhatsApp order
   - Order saved to database

2. **Order Processing**
   - Automatic order reference generation
   - Delivery fee calculation
   - Order saved with pending status
   - WhatsApp message formatted and sent
   - Admin can view and manage in dashboard
