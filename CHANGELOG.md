## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **WhatsApp Cloud API Integration:**
  - Orders are now sent to the backend, which uses the WhatsApp Cloud API to notify admin, delivery agents (per town), and the user.
  - Supports multiple delivery agents per town.
  - Users receive a WhatsApp confirmation message after placing an order.
  - Phone numbers are normalized to international format before sending messages.
- **Order Status Updates:**
  - Delivery agents/admins can update order status by sending WhatsApp messages (e.g., "CONFIRM CHP-12345") to the business number.
  - Backend webhook processes incoming WhatsApp messages, updates order status in Supabase, and notifies the user.
  - Admins can update order status directly from the backend dashboard.
- **Frontend User Experience:**
  - Thank You page is shown instantly after order submission and auto-redirects to the homepage after 3 seconds.
  - Order saving and WhatsApp messaging are handled in the background for a faster user experience.
  - Users are notified via toast if backend processing fails, but the Thank You flow is not interrupted.
- **Admin Backend Improvements:**
  - Restaurant and dish image/logo fields now use file uploads to Supabase Storage (no manual URLs).
  - Improved UI/UX for image uploads, including previews and file name display.
- **Security & Best Practices:**
  - All secrets (API keys, tokens, phone numbers) are handled via environment variables.
  - No sensitive data is exposed in the frontend or committed to the repo.
  - Backend logs detailed error responses for easier debugging.
  - CORS is enabled for backend endpoints.
- **Supabase Integration:**
  - Order status is stored and updated in Supabase.
  - Saving user town now uses upsert to avoid duplicate key errors.

### Changed
- **Codebase/Deployment:**
  - All changes committed and pushed to the git repository.
  - Backend and frontend are decoupled: the frontend never exposes secrets or handles WhatsApp logic directly.
