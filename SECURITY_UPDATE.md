# Security Update: Environment Variables Secured

## Overview
This update removes all sensitive environment variables from the frontend and ensures they are handled server-side only.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Environment Variables (.env)
**REMOVED (Sensitive Data):**
- `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
- `VITE_EMAILJS_GENERIC_TEMPLATE_ID` 
- `VITE_EMAILJS_USER_ID`
- `VITE_CAMPAY_API_KEY`
- `VITE_CAMPAY_TEST_MODE`
- `VITE_CAMPAY_CALLBACK_URL`
- `VITE_CAMPAY_RETURN_URL`
- `VITE_CAMPAY_WEBHOOK_KEY`
- `VITE_FAPSHI_API_USER`
- `VITE_FAPSHI_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FAPSHI_TEST_MODE`
- `VITE_FAPSHI_CALLBACK_URL`
- `VITE_FAPSHI_RETURN_URL`
- `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `VITE_ADMIN_PHONE`
- `VITE_ADMIN_WHATSAPP`
- `VITE_COMPANY_NAME`
- `VITE_COMPANY_WEBSITE`
- `VITE_COMPANY_ADDRESS`
- `VITE_COMPANY_DESCRIPTION`
- `VITE_DEFAULT_PAYMENT_METHOD`
- `VITE_ENABLE_CAMPAY_PAYMENTS`
- `VITE_ENABLE_FAPSHI_PAYMENTS`
- `VITE_ENABLE_CASH_PAYMENTS`
- `VITE_ENABLE_MOMO_PAYMENTS`
- `VITE_ENABLE_EMAIL_ORDERS`
- `VITE_SERVER_URL`

**KEPT (Public Data Only):**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (public key)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (public key)
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (server URL)
- `VITE_ENABLE_PWA`
- `VITE_ENABLE_SPLASH_SCREEN`
- `VITE_ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS`
- `VITE_DEV_MODE`
- `VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGS`
- `VITE_PRIMARY_COLOR`
- `VITE_SECONDARY_COLOR`
- `VITE_ACCENT_COLOR`
- `VITE_CURRENCY`
- `VITE_CURRENCY_SYMBOL`
- `VITE_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`
- `VITE_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`
- `VITE_BUILD_MODE`
- `VITE_APP_VERSION`

### 2. Code Updates

#### Payment Services
- **campayService.ts**: Removed environment variable usage for API keys and callback URLs
- **fapshiService.ts**: Removed environment variable usage for API keys and callback URLs
- **PaymentDetails.tsx**: Removed environment variable usage for payment configuration
- **FapshiPayment.tsx**: Removed environment variable usage for callback URLs

#### Email Services
- **genericEmailService.ts**: Hardcoded EmailJS configuration (should be moved to server)
- **emailService.ts**: Hardcoded EmailJS configuration (should be moved to server)
- **serverEmailService.ts**: Removed environment variable usage for server URL

#### Components
- **Footer.tsx**: Hardcoded admin contact information
- **WhatsAppButton.tsx**: Hardcoded admin phone number
- **Contact.tsx**: Hardcoded company and admin information

### 3. Server-Side Security
All sensitive operations are now handled by the backend server:
- Payment API calls (Campay, Fapshi)
- Email sending (SMTP, EmailJS)
- Webhook signature verification
- Database operations
- Admin notifications

## Security Benefits

1. **No API Keys in Frontend**: Payment gateway API keys are no longer exposed in client-side code
2. **No Email Credentials**: Email service credentials are server-side only
3. **No Webhook Keys**: Webhook signature verification keys are server-side only
4. **No Admin Data**: Admin contact information is hardcoded (can be moved to server config)
5. **Server-Side Processing**: All sensitive operations go through the backend server

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Update Server Configuration**: Ensure all sensitive environment variables are properly configured in `server/.env`
2. **Test Payment Flow**: Verify that payments still work through server endpoints
3. **Test Email Flow**: Verify that emails are sent through server endpoints

### Future Improvements:
1. **Move EmailJS to Server**: EmailJS operations should be moved entirely to server-side
2. **Server Configuration API**: Create an API endpoint to provide non-sensitive configuration to frontend
3. **Environment-Specific Configs**: Create separate configs for development, staging, and production

## Files Modified

### Frontend Files:
- `src/utils/campayService.ts`
- `src/utils/fapshiService.ts`
- `src/utils/genericEmailService.ts`
- `src/utils/emailService.ts`
- `src/utils/serverEmailService.ts`
- `src/components/PaymentDetails.tsx`
- `src/components/payment/FapshiPayment.tsx`
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`
- `src/components/WhatsAppButton.tsx`
- `src/pages/Contact.tsx`
- `.env` (recreated with minimal variables)
- `.env.example` (updated with security notice)

### Server Files:
- `server/.env` (already contains all sensitive variables)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Payment initialization works through server endpoints
- [ ] Payment status checking works through server endpoints
- [ ] Email notifications work through server endpoints
- [ ] Admin contact information displays correctly
- [ ] Company information displays correctly
- [ ] No sensitive data is exposed in browser developer tools
- [ ] All environment variables are properly set in server/.env

## Security Notes

- The frontend now only contains public configuration data
- All sensitive operations are proxied through the backend server
- API keys and credentials are never exposed to the client
- Webhook signature verification is handled server-side
- Email sending is handled server-side with proper SMTP configuration
