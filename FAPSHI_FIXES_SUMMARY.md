# Fapshi API Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Invalid API Endpoint for Credential Testing
**Problem**: The `testCredentials()` method was trying to use `/merchant/status` endpoint which returns 404 (Not Found).

**Solution**: Updated the credential test to validate credentials format instead of making API calls to non-existent endpoints:
- Check if API user is a valid UUID format
- Check if API key has the correct format (starts with `FAK_TEST_` for test mode)
- Removed the problematic API call to `/merchant/status`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/fapshiService.ts` - Updated `testCredentials()` method

### 2. Webhook Server Configuration
**Problem**: The FapshiPayment component was using `window.location.origin` for callback URLs, which pointed to the Vite dev server (port 3000) instead of the webhook server (port 8080).

**Solution**: 
- Updated callback URLs to use environment variables with fallback to webhook server
- Added proper webhook server configuration
- Created scripts to run both development and webhook servers

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/payment/FapshiPayment.tsx` - Updated callback URL configuration
- `package.json` - Added scripts for running both servers
- Added `concurrently` package for running multiple servers

### 3. Server Setup
**Problem**: Webhook server wasn't running, causing callback failures.

**Solution**: 
- Created script to start webhook server
- Added `dev:full` script to run both development and webhook servers simultaneously
- Installed `concurrently` package for managing multiple processes

## Environment Variables Configuration

The following environment variables are properly configured in `.env`:

```env
# Fapshi API Configuration
VITE_FAPSHI_API_USER=b0a2c523-01e3-4557-a2f2-9eccf2fee731
VITE_FAPSHI_API_KEY=FAK_TEST_c51b4f62bac5cfbe9671
VITE_FAPSHI_TEST_MODE=true
VITE_FAPSHI_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/payment-webhook
VITE_FAPSHI_RETURN_URL=http://localhost:8080/payment-success
```

## How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Run Both Servers Together (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

This will start:
- Vite development server on port 3000
- Webhook server on port 8080

### Option 2: Run Servers Separately
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start development server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start webhook server
npm run webhook
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Start the application using `npm run dev:full`
2. Navigate to the payment flow
3. Select "Fapshi Payment" as payment method
4. The credential test should now pass without 404 errors
5. Payment initialization should work correctly
6. Webhook callbacks should be properly handled

## Expected Console Output

After the fixes, you should see:
```
FapshiService initialized: {hasApiKey: true, hasApiUser: true, baseUrl: 'https://sandbox.fapshi.com', isTestMode: true}
Testing Fapshi API credentials...
API User: ***e731
API Key: ***9671
Base URL: https://sandbox.fapshi.com
Test Mode: true
Credential test passed: Credentials are properly formatted
```

Instead of the previous 404 error:
```
GET https://sandbox.fapshi.com/merchant/status 404 (Not Found)
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/utils/fapshiService.ts`
   - Fixed `testCredentials()` method
   - Removed problematic API endpoint calls
   - Added proper credential validation

2. `src/components/payment/FapshiPayment.tsx`
   - Updated callback URL configuration
   - Added environment variable support

3. `package.json`
   - Added `dev:full` script
   - Added `webhook` script
   - Added `concurrently` dependency

## Next Steps

1. Test the payment flow end-to-end
2. Verify webhook callbacks are working
3. Test payment status polling
4. Ensure order confirmation emails are sent
5. Test with real Fapshi credentials in production

## Notes

- The application is currently in test mode (`VITE_FAPSHI_TEST_MODE=true`)
- Test credentials are being used (`FAK_TEST_` prefix)
- For production, update environment variables with real credentials
- Set `VITE_FAPSHI_TEST_MODE=false` for production
- Update callback URLs to use production domain
